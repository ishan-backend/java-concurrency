There's a live video streaming which can start at any time - say start time, it may end or continue to stream indefinitely.
This live video is streamed to a satellite which relays the data to users across the globe.

Your solution should be centered around satellite and how would you store the video frames arriving at 60 FPS and then relay it to users in real time on consumer end.

Users may join the stream and leave the stream at any time.
Users should receive current frame at that time being streamed from source.

If all users are offline, it should not bloat the producer and streaming must continue.

Now go ahead with your solution
